	<p>Notes about program:</p>
	<p class = "tabbed">- This program will not function well on most mobile devices and will play best in Chrome or Firefox.</p>
	<p class = "tabbed">- I used the JavaScript framework <a href = "http://threejs.org/" target = "_blank">Three.js</a> to run the app.  
		The 3D models were created in 3ds max.  
		The animation is driven partly by Three.js and partly by <a href = "http://www.createjs.com/#!/TweenJS" target = "_blank">Tween.js</a>.</p>
	<p class = "tabbed">- An animation can be played by clicking on the IGN logo.  After the animation plays, clicking on the logo again will
		lead the user to IGN's website.  The mouse can also be used to move the camera by clicking on a blank area.</p><br><br>
