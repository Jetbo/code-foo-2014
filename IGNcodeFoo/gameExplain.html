	<p>Notes on the game:</p>
	<p class = "tabbed">I did not have time to finish this, the implementation is very rudimentary compared to actual Pac-Man.
	The game doesn't have controls for mobile yet.
	The game uses the javascript library <a href = "http://phaser.io/" target = "_blank">Phaser</a> for the framework.  
	Sometimes the game collision breaks when the FPS drops dramatically.</p><br>
	<p>Description of Game:</p>
	<p class = "tabbed">The goal was to make the game like Pac-Man. My "Pac-Man" is a red blood cell that travels through the body (veins).
	The "pac-dots"/"pellets" would be little oxygen molecules.
	The red blood cell would upgrade into a white blood cell when it got one of the power pellets. 
	The "ghosts" would be various bacteria.  I created a regular Pac-Man tileset for the board because I ran out of time to create a good looking and relevant tileset.</p><br>
