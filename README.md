IGN's Code-Foo 2014
=============

Hello my name is Adam Sligar and I am applying for IGN's Code-Foo 2014. All answers will be in the repository in the form of a dynamic, responsive webpage.  The webpage can be viewed live at http://www.adamsligar.com/IGNcodeFoo/

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including various js libraries), PHP, and Ajax to create the site.  The stock android mobile browser may not work if it's old, just use Chrome/Firefox/Opera mobile if so.

Refer to the various explanation links for program explanations and breakdowns, I also commented most of the important code.
